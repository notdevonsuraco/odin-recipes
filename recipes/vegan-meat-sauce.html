    <h2>A Meatless Meat Sauce (...wat)</h2>
    <p>This Meat Sauce has NO MEAT! That's Right! So even your hipster homies can enjoy it!</p>
    <p><strong>WHAT YOU NEED, YO!</strong></p>
       <ul>
            <li>1 yellow onion, rough chopped</li>
            <li>1 carrot, rough chopped</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, rough chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil (I use Avocado Oil)</li>
            <li>1 pound of BEYOND MEAT (or Impossible. Whatever you can get your hands on. Doesn't matter if it's from the freezer section as long as it can crumble)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white whine or dry vermouth</li>
            <li>1 - 15oz can of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cups VEGAN beef broth (oh yes, it's a thing. Look it up!)</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of Almond Milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (for a lil kick. Use less if you'd like)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
         </ul>
   
         <strong>WHAT YOU DO, YO!</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Put onion, carrot & celery into a processor, and pulse until finely minced</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil and add the vegetables - cook until soft, about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Put in garlic and cook until fragrant, about a minute then add your "meat" of choice, getting a little bit of color and breaking it up as you go</li>
            <li>Add wine (or vermout) and bring mixture to a simmer, and cook until wine is mostly reduced</li>
            <li>Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, "beef" stock, bay leaf, oregano, pepper flakes and balsamic vinegar - mix well, reduce heat and simmer for about an hour</li>
            <li>Remove the bay leaf and add milk - stir well, bring to a simmer stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper and serve...or elope, leave behind your frineds and family, and live forever in the mountains of Italy</li>
        </ol>
